No.,TC ID,TEST SCENARIO,PRE CONDITION,POST CONDITION,PRIORITY,COMMENTS
1,TAES-001,Test basic AES encryption and decryption with text key,Valid text input and encryption key,Input text is encrypted and then successfully decrypted back to original,High,Core encryption/decryption functionality test
2,TAES-002,Verify using a hexadecimal key correctly encrypts and decrypts data,Valid input text and hexadecimal encryption key,Input text is encrypted with hex key and successfully decrypted,Medium,Tests alternative key format functionality
3,TAES-003,Test handling of short and long encryption keys,Encryption keys shorter and longer than ideal 16 bytes,Keys are properly padded or truncated and encryption works correctly,High,Validates key preprocessing functionality - FAILED: Key length handling failed: Short key: false, Long key: false
4,TAES-004,Test encryption and decryption with empty input,Empty input string,Function handles empty input gracefully without errors,Medium,Robustness test for edge cases
5,TAUT-001,Test basic autokey encryption and decryption with a simple key,Valid text input and alphabetic encryption key,Input text is encrypted and successfully decrypted back to original,High,Core functionality test
6,TAUT-002,Verify autokey works with mixed case and normalizes properly,Mixed case input text with special characters,Text is normalized and properly encrypted/decrypted,Medium,Tests text normalization behavior
7,TAUT-003,Ensure autokey properly handles empty inputs,Empty input string or empty key,Empty input returns empty output, empty key throws error,Medium,Tests edge case handling
8,TAUT-004,Test encryption of longer text passages,Long input text with a short key,Long text is correctly encrypted and decrypted,Low,Tests performance with larger inputs
9,TVIG-001,Test basic Vigenère encryption and decryption with a simple key,Valid text input and alphabetic encryption key,Input text is encrypted and successfully decrypted back to original,High,Core functionality test
10,TVIG-002,Verify Vigenère correctly repeats the key for longer plaintext,Long input text with short key that needs to repeat,Text is properly encrypted with repeating key and then decrypted,Medium,Tests key repetition behavior
11,TVIG-003,Ensure Vigenère properly filters non-alphabetic characters,Input text with mixed alphanumeric and special characters,Non-alphabetic characters are correctly filtered during encryption,Medium,Tests text normalization behavior
12,TVIG-004,Test empty input and empty key handling,Empty input string or empty key,Empty input returns empty output, empty key throws error,Low,Tests edge case handling
